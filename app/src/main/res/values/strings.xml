    <string name="aboutPSL">The native language of Pakistanâ€™s Deaf community is Pakistan Sign Language (PSL). Similar to spoken languages, PSL has a variety of dialects in different regions of the country. While many common words are shared, some will be regional-specific. Deaf educators and leaders nationwide have reviewed our PSL Dictionary, and we will continue to update words and signs in order to fully document PSL usage nationwide.</string>
